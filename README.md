This project generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number using a recursive Python function. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The program takes a positive integer input and calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number, printing each value in the sequence. It includes input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number. This project demonstrates recursion in Python and can be a helpful reference for understanding how recursive algorithms work in generating sequences.

_HOW TO USE THE CODE:-_
1) Input a number: The program prompts you to enter a positive integer.
2) Check validity: If the input is negative, the program returns an error message.
3) Run Fibonacci: The function fibonacci(n) recursively computes the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number.
4) Display output: The program prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the entered number.
5) Execution: Copy the code into a Python (.py) file, then run it via a terminal or Python environment (e.g., python filename.py).
